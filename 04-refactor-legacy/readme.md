# Lab 04 — Refactoring legacy code

### 🎯 Goal

Use Copilot Chat (Agent Mode) to refactor legacy / messy code into clean, readable Python.

---

## ✅ Task

1. Open the file provided in this folder (e.g., `example01.py`).
2. Ask Copilot to explain what the code does.
3. Ask Copilot to refactor the code into a clean, readable version.
4. Review changes and accept if correct.

> Do **not** rewrite the code manually — let Copilot refactor it.

---

## 🔧 Prompts to use

### 1. Understand the code

```python
/explain Explain what this code does, step by step.
```

### 2. Refactor and clean code

```python
/fix Refactor this code to modern, clean Python. Improve naming and formatting. Do not change the logic.
```

### 3. Optional — add comments

```python
Add comments that explain key steps of the function.
```

## ✅ Success criteria

* Code is easier to read (clear names, clean formatting)
* Behavior of the code is unchanged
* No manual rewriting — refactor done by Copilot
