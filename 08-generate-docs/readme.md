# Lab 08 – Generate documentation using Copilot

## 🎯 Goal

Use **GitHub Copilot Chat** to automatically generate:

* docstrings for functions/classes
* README.md documentation
* usage example

You will NOT write documentation manually — Copilot will.

---

## 📂 Files in this folder

* `order.py` – contains working code without documentation

---

## 🧪 Task

Your goal is to turn an undocumented script into a well‑documented module.

1. Open `order.py`
2. Ask Copilot:

```python
/explain what does this code do? Add docstrings to all functions.
```

3. Then generate a README:

```python
Generate order_README.md for this code, including:
- description
- usage example
- instructions to run
```

4. Create a SVG flow diagram:

```python
Create flow diagram to SVG file
```

---

## ✅ Success criteria

* All functions in `order.py` have docstrings
* A new `order_README.md` file is created by Copilot
* README includes usage example

---

> Tip: You are not writing docs. You are telling Copilot to write them.

When done → Continue to next lab.
