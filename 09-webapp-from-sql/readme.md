# Lab 10 — Generate a Full CRUD Python Web Application using Copilot

### 🎯 Goal

Use **GitHub Copilot** to generate a complete web application using:

* **Python + Flask**
* **Jinja2 templates**
* **Bootstrap UI**
* **SQLite database**

The application must support CRUD operations for two tables:

* `categories`
* `products`

Database structure and sample data are provided in the `schema.sql` file.
The goal is to let **Copilot generate the application**, not manually write the code.

---

## ✅ What we will do

1. Create a new project folder in VS Code.
2. Add the provided `schema.sql` to the project.
3. Use Copilot Chat to generate the app structure and code.
4. Copilot will create:

   * folders (`app/`, `database/`)
   * Flask application setup
   * CRUD routes for Products and Categories
   * Jinja templates using Bootstrap
   * requirements.txt, README.md, MIT License
5. Run the application and verify CRUD operations.
6. Commit and push to GitHub.

> 🧠 You are not coding — you are guiding Copilot.

## 🔧 Prompt to paste into Copilot Chat

```
Create a full Python Flask application that implements CRUD for the database schema stored in schema.sql.

Requirements:
- Use Flask + Jinja2 + Bootstrap
- Use SQLite3 (built-in Python library)
- Application structure:

Create a new rootfolder - webapp and inside create:

app/
  __init__.py
  models/
  routes/
  templates/
  static/
database/
  schema.sql

Features:
- List / Add / Edit / Delete for Categories and Products
- Products must be linked to Categories (dropdown in form)
- Validation when DB is empty
- Confirmation pages after Add/Edit/Delete
- Navigation bar with links: Home, Categories, Products
- Home → dashboard with counts of records

Extras:
- Create requirements.txt and LICENSE (MIT)
- Add README.md with instructions
- Run via: flask --app app run --debug

Generate code step-by-step and **ask before creating each file**.
```

---

## ▶️ Running the app

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask --app app run --debug
```

---

## ✅ Success criteria

* The app starts without errors
* You can list, add, edit and delete categories and products
* The UI has navigation and uses a shared layout file
* No code was manually written — everything was generated by Copilot
